# Resources:
Here are the resources I sued in order to assist with the development of this repo.

I used this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdgIWTYQ69A&ab_channel=JonathanSoma) to install and work with setting up .env for this assignment.

I used the [dotenv documentation](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) for troubleshooting.
